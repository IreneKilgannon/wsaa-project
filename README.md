This is my repository for the Big Project for the semester three module, Web Services and Applications for a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University. This project is worth 60% of the overall marks. Deadline 26th May 2025.

__Project Brief__

Write a program that demonstrates that you understand creating and consuming RESTful APIs. 

Create a Web application in Flask that has a RESTful API, the application should link to one or more database tables.
You should also create the web pages that can consume the API i.e. performs CRUD operations on the data.

__Project Outline__

My hobby is dressmaking and I have an extensive collection of sewing patterns. I also have 4 close relations who sew and a common question in our group chat is does anyone have x pattern?

My plan for this project is to have a database of sewing patterns. The database will have two tables, users and patterns. Each user will be to perform CRUD operations on the data.
