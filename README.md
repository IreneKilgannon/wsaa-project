This is my repository for the Big Project for the semester three module, Web Services and Applications for a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University. This project is worth 60% of the overall marks. Deadline 26th May 2025.

__Project Brief__

Write a program that demonstrates that you understand creating and consuming RESTful APIs. 

Create a Web application in Flask that has a RESTful API, the application should link to one or more database tables.
You should also create the web pages that can consume the API i.e. performs CRUD operations on the data.

__Project Outline__

My hobby is dressmaking and I have an extensive collection of sewing patterns. I also have 4 close relations who also sew and a common question in our group chat is does anyone have x pattern? Or who has my pattern? 

My plan for this project is to have a database of sewing patterns. The database will have two tables, users and patterns. Each user will be to perform CRUD operations on the data.

My dream project would have the following features:

    Each user logs into the web page.

    View the patterns with images.

    Add their own patterns. Delete patterns.

    Search the patterns by number or by description e.g. find a V-neck dress pattern.

    Checkboxes to indicate if a user has borrowed a pattern and when. Ability to send an email at the click of a button if the owner would like the pattern returned!

- [ ] Set up the database, sewing_patterns. 
- [ ] Create the tables, users and patterns
- [ ] Config file
- [ ] Write and test the DAO
- [ ] Write the Flask file
- [ ] Test Flask file in the virtual environment. Need requirements.txt file
- [ ] Create HTML web pages. Think about layout. A lot of research needed here to make web page look nice. Needs to be stylish. 
- [ ] Research how to send emails with Python.
- [ ] Rewatch lectures on AJAX and HTML again. Research. 
- [ ] Host the application online e.g. Azure or PythonAnywhere. Research.
